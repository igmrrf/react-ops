## Dependencies

-   Yup
-   Emotion

# Project Map

-   public

    -   index.html

            -   index.js

## Getting Started

simply clone the repository to your local development environment.

### Installing

```
Run "yarn", "yarn install", "yarn add", "npm i", "npm install"
```

To get all the dependencies install on your development environment

### Running

Then run `"yarn start" or "npm start"` to get the project running within your local machine on `port: 3000` but if there's already a running program a prompt will be giving if you'd like to run it on another port.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy start, build and deploy a react projectn.

### Prerequisites

You need basic understanding of HTML/CSS and react componets

## Running the tests

Run `"yarn test", "npm test" or "jest` to start run the testing of all the tests pre speculated in the project

### Break down into end to end tests

These test are made up so incase while playing around with the boiler code and anything breaks, you'll know exactly what broke, why it broke, what it was expecting and what it got.

```
Test: App Rendering
```

The App Rendering test, tests to see that the App functin renders correctly without crashing, and if in any case your App crashes or is going to crash, that test will fail and sav you from building.

### And coding style tests

These test checks your style sheets to see that you don't make two css lines of code for a single effect and tries to minimize your errors.

```
Background Test
```

This test to make sure the `background:` css option accepts anything but colors and the `background-color:` accepts nothing but color to clearly seperate and use this feature relevantly

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
